      <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The definition of education has been explored by theorists from various
        fields. Many agree that education is a purposeful activity aimed at achieving certain goals, which
        include the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits.However, there is extensive debate
        regarding its exact nature beyond these general features. Some theorists view education primarily as a process
        that occurs during educational events such as schooling, teaching, and learning.Others perceive it not
        as a process but as the product resulting from this process, emphasizing the mental states and dispositions of
        educated persons. Additionally, the term may also refer to an academic field that studies the methods,
        processes, and social institutions involved in teaching and learning. The term "education" is derived from
        the Latin words educare, meaning "bring up, rear, educate", primarily related to the mind, and educere, meaning
        "bring out, lead forth", and refers to the bodily level.

      <p class="sectionTag text-big">The real definition of education</p>
      <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits.
        There are many debates about its precise definition, for example, about which aims it tries to achieve. A
        further issue is whether part of the meaning of education is that the change in the student is an improvement.
        Some researchers stress the role of critical thinking to distinguish education from indoctrination. These
        disagreements affect how to identify, measure, and improve forms of education. The term can also refer to the
        mental states and qualities of educated people. Additionally, it can mean the academic field studying education.

      <p class="sectionTag text-big">The types of education</p>
      <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">There are many types of education. Formal education happens in a complex
        institutional framework, like public schools. Non-formal education is also structured but happens outside the
        formal schooling system. Informal education is unstructured learning through daily experiences. Formal and
        non-formal education are divided into levels. They include early childhood education, primary education,
        secondary education, and tertiary education. Other classifications focus on the teaching method, like
        teacher-centered and student-centered education. Forms of education can also be distinguished by subject, like
        science education, language education, and physical education.</p>


      <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
        Some theorists provide precise definitions by identifying the specific features that are exclusive to all forms
        of education. R. S. Peters, for instance, outlines three essential features for education:

        It is concerned with the transmission of knowledge and understanding.
        This transmission is worthwhile.
        It is done in a morally appropriate manner in tune with the student's interests
